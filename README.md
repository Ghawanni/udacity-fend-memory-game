# udacity-fend-memory-game
Udacity's frontend nanodegree's 2nd project


### Game Mechanics;
The game is very simple with the following mechanics:
- Ability to try and choose to cards and see if they match or not
- Reset button to restart the game
- A timer that shows how fast your game session was
- A star records that get decreased to a minimum of 1 star after every 3 incorrect moves

### Game View:
The view of the game has been built over the skeleton Udacity provided with minimal additions. Winning the game will display a modal that will show your time & star record. From that modal you're given the option to restart the game.

### Dependencies:
The game uses Bootstrap components to look consistent.
JQuery is used only in previewing the modal after the game is done.
